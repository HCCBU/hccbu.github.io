   <h3>Panagiotis (Panos) D. Ritsos</h3>
     <p>I am a Senior Lecturer in Visualization, at the <a href="http://www.cs.bangor.ac.uk/" target="_blank">School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering</a>, <a href="http://www.bangor.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Bangor University, UK</a>, and lead the <a href="https://xrvalab.github.io/" target="_blank">XRVA) Lab</a>. My research interests lie in the domain of human-computer interaction, and include mixed and virtual reality, information visualization and visual analytics. I am particularly interested in potential synergies between these fields within different flavours of human-data interaction, such as beyond-the-desktop visualization, and ubiquitous, situated and immersive analytics. You can find more about me at <a href="https://pdritsos.com/" target="_blank">my personal page.</a></p>

   <h3>Llyr app Cenydd</h3>
     <p>I am a Lecturer in the <a href="http://www.cs.bangor.ac.uk/" target="_blank">School of Computer Science and Engineering</a>, <a href="http://www.bangor.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Bangor University, UK</a> and the admissions tutor for undergrad computer science. My research interests include virtual and mixed reality, real-time computer graphics, procedural animation, and artificial intelligence. Alongside my academic work, I develop commercial VR games in partnership with industry leaders like Meta. These include the underwater safari park experience Ocean Rift and the sci-fi action game Crashland.</p>
