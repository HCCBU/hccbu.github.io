There is a huge opportunity to use Virtual Reality (VR) to help people understand the Boiling Water Reactor. Through using VR, users would be able to walk around, see how the BWR works, interact with it, and become excited about its function and technology, through the excitement of the VR experience itself.

This feasibility study aims to develop a prototype HMD-based VR demonstration of an ABWR facility. It aims to present to the user 3D simulations of how an Advanced Boiling Water Reactor works. By providing this immersive demonstration, users can learn about this technology, its significance, explore the facility virtually and learn about the potential of nuclear power in an immersive, interactive and highly engaging manner. The prototype will be designed from the outset to be extensible and adaptable to include additional information in the future, such as data-driven informational annotations and immersive visual analytics.

You can find more information in the [BWR Research Hub and Network](https://www.bwrhub.ac.uk/en/) website.
