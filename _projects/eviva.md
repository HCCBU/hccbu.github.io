Project EVIVA was a follow-up project of IVY, with 5 partners (EU Lifelong Learning Progamme - Project 511862-2010-LLP-UK-KA-KA3MP). The project’s aims were (a) to investigate the efficiency of VLEs and how they support different learning activities, and how learners from diverse backgrounds learn by using VLEs, (b) to develop innovative evaluation methods for interpreter-mediated communications by combining traditional methods of assessment, with methods such as introspection, corpus analysis and visual analytics, and (c) to formulate design recommendations for building VLEs for interpreting.
