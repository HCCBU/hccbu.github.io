The United Kingdom Visual Analytics Consortium (UKVAC) was a partnership of UK universities with a shared interest in establishing a multi-disciplinary scientific community in the UK dedicated to promoting and contributing to the visual analytics research and development agenda in the UK. Activities included reporting on alternative implementations of hierarchical visualization (with example use-case the US Flight Data set) and a design of an experiential learning model for Visual Analytics (VA). The work on UKVAC inspired a series of other projects related to Educational practices in Computer Science (FDS, EVF and forthcoming work).
