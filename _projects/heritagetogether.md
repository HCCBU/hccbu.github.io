This project included various contributions to the larger [HeritageTogether](http://heritagetogether.org/?lang=en) AHRC project: a) the creation of a web standards-based, non-browser specific Augmented Reality application for the in-situ recreation of standing-stone shrine sites and dolmen, located in North Wales, and b) the web-based 3D model gallery, employing X3DOM and displaying models of said sites, created via photogrammetry.
