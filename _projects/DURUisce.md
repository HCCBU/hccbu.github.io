Within the activities of [Dŵr Uisce - Distributing our Water Resources: Utilising Integrated, Smart and low-Carbon Energy](https://www.dwr-uisce.eu/) project, on which we collaborated with the [School of Natural Sciences](https://www.bangor.ac.uk/sns), we developed a tool for visualizing transdiciplinary research (TDR) project meta-data, such as workpackages, activities, stakeholder collaborations and deliverables. TDR is being increasingly used to address broad challenges through project-based research. Such project structures utilize a range of disciplinary research perspectives as well as input from external stakeholders, potentially leading to greater societal impacts and more holistic outputs. 

With this work we introduce DUVis, an interactive visual data exploration tool developed primarily to map internal and external collaboration within TDR projects. As well as using a node-link diagram to map collaboration, DUVis provides a number of secondary visualizations and additional features to facilitate data exploration and story telling. We present a user-experience evaluation of the work, extracting insights on how DUVis and similar tools, can provide a unique perspective for project managers of TDR projects, and how they are perceived from non-visualization-expert project participants. 

The current public version of our tool can be accessed [here](https://dwruisce.github.io/DUVis/). 

[Dŵr Uisce](https://www.bangor.ac.uk/sns) is part funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the [Ireland Wales Co-operation programme 2014-2020](https://irelandwales.eu/).
