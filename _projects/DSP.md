Bangor University’s [Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Centre of Excellence](http://dsp-centre.bangor.ac.uk/), is a £6M research centre undertaking highly specialised research into digital communication systems such as 5G networks and ecosystems. 
One aspect of the DSP Centre is the development of novel applications that make use of these 'future networks', and technologies such as edge computing, IoT, and XR.

This theme has strong synergies with the themes of [Immersive Analytics]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/ia.md %}) and broader work on XR, such as medical training simulations.

XR or XReality is the fusion of real and computer-generated elements towards the production of new hybrid - synthetic - environments. As a field, it encompasses the full spectrum of immersive technologies, and includes Virtual, Mixed and Augmented Realities (i.e., the 'X' is variable). XR activities are a core theme of the [Bangor Immersive Environments Lab (BIEL)](https://bangor-iel.github.io/).

Links to prototypes and publications specific to DSP use-cases will be posted here, as they become available/public.
