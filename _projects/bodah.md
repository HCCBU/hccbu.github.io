Tourism is a major engine of economic development, but it also creates a burden difficult to bear among the inhabitants Mass tourism is promoted for destinations of great cultural, historical and heritage importance, some of them also classified as World Heritage sites by UNESCO. BODAH aims at improving cooperation, joint planning and at better managing conflicting interests to improve the management of two kind of cultural destinations that can benefit and be affected by tourism and the pressure of local citizens: Old-historical city centres and Sites of particular cultural or heritage interest. The project plans to take advantage of technology and innovation in management tools (Smart Cities), in particular, through the collection of existing - and generation of complementary - data (Big Data, Open Data, Internet of the Things, data provided through existing sensors, local systems or cameras, etc.). One of the key objectives is to develop new solutions to address social and public needs, contributing to create new alternative offers adapted to the interests of visitors to better distribute their crowd flows, as well as redistribute impacts (both, environmental and economic ones) on heritage sites, cities and monuments.

BODAH is funded under the <a href="https://keep.eu/programmes/59" target="_blank">2014 - 2020 INTERREG VB Atlantic Area Programme</a>
