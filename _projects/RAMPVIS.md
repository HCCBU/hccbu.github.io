The COVID-19 pandemic has generated significant interest in data visualization, demonstrated from the media's, and governmental and research organizations' use of visualizations to inform the public. Within these theme, we are working on the [EPSRC funded project (EP/V054236/1)](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FV054236%2F1) _RAMP VIS: Making Visual Analytics an Integral Part of the Technological Infrastructure for Combating COVID-19_ (01/2020 - 12/2020).

This work is continuation of our volunteering work in the [Rapid Assistance in Modelling the Pandemic (RAMP)](https://epcced.github.io/ramp/) initiative. Bangor VIS experts, [along with some twenty VIS scientists](https://sites.google.com/view/rampvis/home), researchers, and developers in the UK answered a call in May 2020 for VIS volunteers to support modelling scientists and epidemiologists in the [Scottish COVID-19 Response Consortium (SCRC)](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/scrc/), which is one of the three consortia in the Royal Society’s [RAMP)](https://epcced.github.io/ramp/) programme.

The Bangor team is involved in efforts of public engagement through visualisation, and creating interfaces suitable for informing the public of the outputs of the modelling stages, as well as more general data-driven guidance on COVID-19.
