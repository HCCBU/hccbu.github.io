Health care professionals can use high-fidelity virtual training simulation (VTS) so that necessary procedures may be practiced and refreshed before operating on a real person. Advantages of relying on such controlled learning environments includes; zero patient risk, development of psychomotor skills for the medical tools and the opportunity to experience challenging ‘what if’ scenarios. In this theme we explore the use of haptics in a series of haptic-enabled biopsy simulators, such as Transperieneal Prostate and Kidney biopsies and immersive, interactive technologies, in scenarios such as wheelchair navigation in VR. We couple haptic devices, such as Phantom Omnis with novel interfaces such as zSpace, Leap Motion and Oculus Rift.
