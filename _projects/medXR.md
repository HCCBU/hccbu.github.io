There has been some previous research into using virtual reality (VR) to help train wheelchair users, but price and technology limitations have been a barrier to commercial adoption (see details in section 2). However, affordable, high fidelity interfaces for VR such as head mounted display are now readily available. We investigated whether a serious game that utilises affordable modern interface technologies can provide a safe environment in which a new user of a powered wheelchair can quickly learn how to operate it, and navigate it, in a variety of different scenarios.
