Creating haptic data visualizations normally requires programming and knowledge of special APIs. However, prototyping tools like the HITPROTO toolkit (by Paneels) can be used for rapid development of interactions for Haptic Data Visualization (HDV). In this theme we evaluated the user experience associated with the HITPROTO toolkit, explored its potential in creating HDVs for blind users, by their mentors and elaborated a formalised HDV creation process. The outcomes of this work included a journal publication in Computers & Graphics and a poster in IEEE VIS 2014.
