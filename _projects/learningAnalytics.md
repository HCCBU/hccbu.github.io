Learning analytics (LA) refers to the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about the progress of learners and the contexts in which learning takes place. In LA, we examine how analytics can be used to improve teaching, learning, student engagement and assessment processes. Current projects, lead by colleagues Cameron Gray and Dave Perkins, are exploring metrics for student pressure in higher education, analytics of attendance and engagement, and visualization-facilitated assessment and programme design. This theme also has strong synergies with Personal Learning Visualization (PLV). PLV is concerned with employing advanced visualization techniques, from the fields of Information Visualization and Visual Analytics, in order to facilitate the sense-making process, say for example for an individual’s learning performance. In the PLV theme learners become producers and consumers of the data, and are essentially immersed in a world of ubiquitous information that influences their learning process.
