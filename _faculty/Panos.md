His research interests lie in the domain of human-computer interaction, and include mixed and virtual reality, information visualization and visual analytics. He is particularly interested in potential synergies between these fields within different flavours of human-data interaction, such as beyond-the-desktop visualization, and ubiquitous, situated and immersive analytics. He is a member of the IEEE, the IEEE Computer Society, the IEEE Visualization and Graphics Technical Committee (VGTC), and the ACM.
