<meta name="description" content="We presented the following two posters and a workshop paper, in the International Conference on Visualization (IEEE VIS 2018), held in Berlin, Germany, on the 21th - 26th of October, 2018. P. W. S. Butcher, N. W. John, and P. D. Ritsos, “Towards a Framework for Immersive Analytics on the Web,” in Posters presented at the IEEE Conference on Visualization (IEEE VIS 2018), Berlin, Germany, 2018. We present work-in-progress on the design and implementation of a Web framework for building Immersive Analytics (IA) solutions in Virtual Reality (VR). We outline the design of our prototype framework, VRIA, which facilitates the development of VR spaces for IA solutions, which can be accessed via a Web browser. VRIA is built on emerging open-standards Web technologies such as WebVR, A-Frame and React, and supports a variety of interaction devices (e.g., smartphones, head-mounted displays etc.). We elaborate on our motivation for focusing on open-standards Web technologies and provide an overview of our framework. We also present two early visualization components. Finally, we outline further extensions and investigations. [Abstract]&nbsp;&nbsp; [Details]&nbsp;&nbsp; [PDF]&nbsp;&nbsp; J. Jackson, P. D. Ritsos, and J. C. Roberts, “Creating Small Unit Based Glyph Visualisations,” in Posters presented at the IEEE Conference on Visualization (IEEE VIS 2018), Berlin, Germany, 2018. Many modern day tasks involve the use of small screens, where users want to see a summary visualisation of an activity. For example, a runner using a smart watch needs to quickly view their progress, heart rate, comparison to previous races, etc. Subsequently, there is a need to portray data to users in small, yet well-defined, spaces. We define this space to be a single self-contained “unit”. In this paper we introduce a glyph visualisation algorithm that creates a diverse range of visualisation designs; each design contains many separate parts, whereupon different parameters can be mapped. Our algorithm uses a path based approach which allows designers to create deterministic, yet unique designs, in a unit space to display multivariate data. [Abstract]&nbsp;&nbsp; [Details]&nbsp;&nbsp; [PDF]&nbsp;&nbsp; D. Varghese, J. C. Roberts, and P. D. Ritsos, “Developing a formative visual feedback report for data brokering,” in Workshop on Visual Summarization and Report Generation, IEEE Conference on Visualization (IEEE VIS 2018), Berlin, Germany, 2018. We present the development of a visualisation framework, used to provide formative feedback to clients who engage with data brokering companies. Data brokers receive, clean, store and re-sell data from many clients. However the usage of the data and the brokering process can be improved at source by enhancing the client’s data creation and management processes. We propose to achieve this through providing formative feedback, as a visualisation report, to the client. Working closely with a travel agent data broker, we present a three-part framework, where we (1) evaluate data creation and provision processes of the client, (2) develop metrics for quantitative analytics on the data, (3) aggregate the analytics in a visual report.
