Gary Hung completed a BSc in Computer Science at Bangor University in 2010 and a PhD for his research "Investigating the Feasibility of Using Focussed Airborne Ultrasound as Tactile Feedback in Medical Simulators" in 2014. His PhD included the building of a novel tactile device called UltraSendo that has been used to mimic pulse and thrill sensations in a virtual patient. He subsequently completed a short post doctoral research position to investigate open source methods for visualising large datasets. He is interested in Haptic technologies and Graphics. Gary now works as a Design Engineer at Magstim Ltd in Whitland, focussing on Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.
