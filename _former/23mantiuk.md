Rafal Mantiuk is a Senior Lecturer in University of Cambridge. Rafal's primary interests are in modelling certain aspects of the human visual system in order to apply these models in computer graphics applications. He investigates the potential of new display technologies, including high dynamic range (high contrast), ultra-low black level, wide colour gamut, high spatial and temporal resolution, to deliver the imagery that fully utilizes the capabilities of the human eye . His interests encompass human visual perception, advanced image processing, image reconstruction, video compression, subjective and objective image quality assessment.
