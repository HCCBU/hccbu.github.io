Franck P. Vidal's main research interests are in modelling and simulating complex and computationally intensive phenomena in medical physics (e.g. photon transport in radiology and radiotherapy), medical imaging (inc. tomographic reconstruction and volume segmentation) and medical graphics. In particular, he is investigating the use of advance visualization methods, programming massively parallel processors, artificial evolution and haptics.
