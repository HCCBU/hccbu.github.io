Robert Wanat received his MSc in Computer Science from West Pomeranian University of Technology in Szczecin, Poland and is now a PhD student on a Bangor University Anniversary Research Scholarship. Robert's interests include high dynamic range (HDR) imaging with a focus on HDR displays, colour perception across a wide range of viewing conditions, human visual system modelling and image appearance. The main goal of his studies is the development of advanced imaging methods that could be used to imitate the appearance of real-life scenes on a computer screen. He completed his PhD in 2015 and is currently working in California.
