Liam Kurmos is currently working on a HEA funded project on 'Optimal view angle selection for time-varying volume data'. More broadly he is interested in identifying topological structure in volume datasets, and plans to incorporate into his PhD research: computational topology, AI, SVMs, and level set segmentation. He has a master's in theoretical Physics and has a long standing interest in modelling and simulation of physical processes.
