Chris Hughes is a Lecturer at University of Salford. Chris completed his BSc in Computer Science in 2003. and obtained a PhD funded by the EPSRC as part of the e-Viz group in 2008. The main area of this research has been based around Augmented Reality (AR) and investigating the use of AR as an interface for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). This work forms part of an exemplar application which will use the e-Viz framework to utilize high performance computers as a backend for rendering the AR graphics over the grid. In 2006, Chris was appointed to be a Research Officer in a EPSRC funded project to develop a physics based simulator for vascular interventional radiology procedures. He was working for the Advanced Medical Imaging and Visualization Unit. He left to work for BBC Research and Development at Salford Quays, Manchester.
