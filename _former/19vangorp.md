Peter's primary interests are in designing and building advanced display systems that include high dynamic range, 3D stereo, motion parallax, and focal cues. Such displays can be used for extremely realistic simulations of shapes and materials in human visual perception research. Peter obtained his PhD in Computer Science from the University of Leuven (Belgium) working on the perception of realistically rendered materials. He has since worked on immersive displays at Inria (France) and high dynamic range displays at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics (Germany).
