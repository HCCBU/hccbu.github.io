Our publication [Contextual Network Navigation; Situational Awareness for Network Administrators](http://pdritsos.com/files/Gray-et-al-VizSec2015.pdf) was presented in the _IEEE Symposium on Visualization for Cyber Security_ held in conjunction with _IEEE VIS2015_. You can have a look at the accepted papers, news and updates from the symposium at  [VisSec](http://vizsec.org/).

<span class="mystrong">Abstract</span> - One of the goals of network administrators is to identify and block sources of attacks from a network steam. Various tools have been developed to help the administrator identify the IP or subnet to be blocked, however these tend to be non-visual. Having a good perception of the wider network can aid the administrator identify their origin, but while network maps of the Internet can be useful for such endeavors, they are difficult to construct, comprehend and even utilize in an attack, and are often referred to as being “hairballs”. We present a visualization technique that displays pathways back to the attacker; we include all potential routing paths with a best-efforts identification of the commercial relationships involved. These two techniques can potentially highlight common pathways and/or networks to allow faster, more complete resolution to the incident, as well as fragile or incomplete routing pathways to/from a network. They can help administrators re-profile their choice of IP transit suppliers to better serve a target audience.
