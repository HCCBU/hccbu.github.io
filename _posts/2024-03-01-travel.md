I attended the Reflections on [Reflections on Pandemic Visualization Dagstuhl Seminar](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/seminars/seminar-calendar/seminar-details/24091), held in the [Computer Science Centre, Schloss Dagstuhl, Germany](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/), between 24/2 and 1/3. 

The purpose of this Dagstuhl Seminar was to bring the visualization community, modelling experts, epidemiologists, infection control experts, and end users together with other application domain experts to reflect on research work done in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Dagstuhl Seminars are the flagship of the event program at Schloss Dagstuhl. They are often praised by participants as the most productive academic events they have ever experienced. Consequently participation is highly coveted. Their topic can be anything that is computer science related. These seminars focus on the exchange and development of ideas and not so much on the presentation of already achieved results. They profit from Dagstuhl's ambience and setup that promote personal interaction and open discussion ([source](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/seminars/dagstuhl-seminars)). 

You can find the outputs produced below.
