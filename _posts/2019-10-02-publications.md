Our publication [Visualizing the University Student Journey](https://doi.org/10.1080/02602938.2019.1676397) is published the journal of [Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/caeh20/current).

Our article reports on the work that we have been involved in which combines the concept of Learning Pictures (Lindsley 1977, All 1977) with contemporary InfoVis techniques, such as Small Multiples, in order to provide enhanced, objective guidance to examiners when making adjustment decisions. Our goal is to improve the sense making process of examiners, during situations such as annual board of studies, where dozens, if not hundreds of students need to be evaluated in terms of their overall performance.
