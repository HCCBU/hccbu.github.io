We have received funding to extend our work on the development of a new decision support visual analytics toolkit, called LUCST ([project page]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/LUCST/)), as a Sprint Project from the [Wales Data Nation Accelerator](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/2520393/Wales-Data-Nation-Accelerator.pdf). The toolkit is to help improve the planning and management of flood alleviation schemes in Gwynedd, and the funded extension is to integrate AI capabilities.

This builds on work done in collaboration with the [School of Natural Sciences](https://www.bangor.ac.uk/natural-sciences/index.php.en) and Gwynedd Council’s consultancy arm [Ymgynghoriaeth Gwynedd Consultancy (YGC)](https://ygc.cymru/). The work was funded by YGC and [Knowledge Economy Skills Scholarships (KESS 2)](http://kess2.ac.uk/), a pan-Wales higher level skills initiative led by Bangor University on behalf of the HE sector in Wales. It is part funded by the Welsh Government’s European Social Fund (ESF) convergence programme for West Wales and the Valleys.
