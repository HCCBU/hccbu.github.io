We presented our work on the VRIA framework, as a Late Breaking work extended abstract in the [_ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2019)_](http://chi2019.acm.org/), held in Glasgow, UK, on the 4th - 9th of May, 2019. 

The work was a preamble, for our more recent journal work available [here]({{site.baseurl}}/news/2020/01/04/publications/)
