Our collaboration with the [School of Natural Sciences](https://www.bangor.ac.uk/natural-sciences/index.php.en) and Gwynedd Council’s consultancy arm [Ymgynghoriaeth Gwynedd Consultancy (YGC)](https://ygc.cymru/) on the development of a new decision support visual analytics toolkit ([project page]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/LUCST/)), that facilitates modelling the impact of land use change on river hydrology and provides valuable insights, has appeared in the [North Wales Chronicle](https://www.northwaleschronicle.co.uk/news/19802617.bangor-researchers-gwynedd-council-manage-flood-risk-using-visual-analytics/).

The toolkit is to help improve the planning and management of flood alleviation schemes in Gwynedd.
