I presented a lightning talk on our [Immersive and Situated Analytics]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/ia/) systems at the DAFNI Wales Roadshow 2024 event, held at the [Computational Foundry](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/computational-foundry/), [Swansea University](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/).  We discussed research into infrastructure systems, synergies with visualization, and the challenges and opportunities of data sharing.
