Our paper ["The Reality of the Situation: A Survey of Situated Analytics"]({{site.baseurl}}/publications#Shin-et-al-TVCG-2023) has been accepted for publication in [IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/tg), and will be presented, later this year, at [IEEE VIS 2023](https://ieeevis.org/year/2023/welcome). In this work, we identify prior literature in this emerging field with a focus on the technologies enabling such situated analytics. We identify archetypical patterns in our classification using an ensemble cluster analysis, gauge the level of support for sensemaking and discuss several insights and design guidelines that we learned from our analysis.
