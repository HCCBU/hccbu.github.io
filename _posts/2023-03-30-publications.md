Our paper ["Evaluating View Management for Situated Visualization in Web-based Handheld AR"]({{site.baseurl}}/publications#Batch-et-al-EuroVis-2023) has been accepted for publication in [Computer Graphics Forum](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14678659), and was presented at [EuroVis 2023](https://www.eurovis.org/). In this paper, we (1) present an analysis of the properties and challenges of view management for situated visualizations in Augmented Reality (AR), (2) revisit existing techniques from the domains of computer graphics, Virtual Reality (VR), and visualization, and (3) evaluate implementations of interaction, layout, and presentation of some of those techniques, accessible in web-based handheld AR.
