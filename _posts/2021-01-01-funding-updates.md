Our project_RAMP VIS: Making Visual Analytics an Integral Part of the Technological Infrastructure for Combating COVID-19_ (01/2020 - 12/2020) has been funderd by the [EPSRC funded project (EP/V054236/1)](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FV054236%2F1). This work is continuation of our volunteering work in the [Rapid Assistance in Modelling the Pandemic (RAMP)](https://epcced.github.io/ramp/) initiative. Bangor VIS experts, [along with some twenty VIS scientists](https://sites.google.com/view/rampvis/home), researchers, and developers in the UK answered a call in May 2020 for VIS volunteers to support modelling scientists and epidemiologists in the [Scottish COVID-19 Response Consortium (SCRC)](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/scrc/), which is one of the three consortia in the Royal Society’s [RAMP)](https://epcced.github.io/ramp/) programme.

The Bangor team is involved in efforts of visual analyics for modellers and epidemiologists (F. Vidal), public engagement through visualisation, data-driven storytelling and interfaces suitable for informing the public of the outputs of the modelling stages (J.C. Roberts, P.D. Ritsos), as well as more general data-driven guidance on COVID-19.
