Our paper ["Don't Pull the Balrog --- Lessons Learned from Designing Wizualization: a Magic-inspired Data Analytics System in XR"]({{site.baseurl}}/publications#Butcher-et-al-HUI-ISMAR2023) has been accepted for publication in [HybridUI: 1st Workshop on Hybrid User Interfaces: Complementary Interfaces for Mixed Reality Interaction](https://hybrid-ui-workshop.io/), taking place during [ISMAR 2023](https://ismar23.org/).

In this paper, we review lessons learned during the development of [Wizualization]({{site.baseurl}}/bibliography/Batch-et-al-TVCG-2024/), a visual analytics system for eXtended Reality (XR) that enables an analyst to author and interact with visualizations using a 'hard-magic' metaphor. Wizualization is based on a fundamentally hybrid and multimodal approach utilizing AR/XR, gestures, sound, and speech to support the mobile setting.
