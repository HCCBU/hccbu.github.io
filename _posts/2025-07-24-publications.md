Our paper [“Spatialstrates: Cross-Reality Collaboration through Spatial Hypermedia]({{site.baseurl}}/publicationsYear#Borowski-et-al-UIST-2025) has been accepted to the [38th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST 2025)](https://uist.acm.org/2025/), to be held in Busan, South Korea, in September 2025. 

This article continues the work on immersive toolkits, explored initially with [DashSpace]({{site.baseurl}}/bibliography/Borowski-et-al-TVCG-2025/), and extends it towards the theme of cross-reality collaboration through spatial hypermedia.

Contemporary consumer-level XR hardware enables immersive spatial computing, yet most knowledge work remains confined to traditional 2D desktop environments. These worlds exist in isolation: writing emails or editing presentations favors desktop interfaces, while viewing 3D simulations or architectural models benefits from immersive environments. 

We address this fragmentation by combining spatial hypermedia, shareable dynamic media, and cross-reality computing to provide (1) composability of heterogeneous content and of nested information spaces through spatial transclusion,(2) pervasive cooperation across heterogeneous devices and platforms, and (3) congruent spatial representations despite underlying environmental differences. 

Our implementation, the Spatialstrates platform, embodies these principles using standard web technologies to bridge 2D desktop and 3D immersive environments.
