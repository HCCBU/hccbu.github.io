Our publication [The explanatory visualization framework: An active learning framework for teaching creative computing using explanatory visualizations](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7192707) was presented in _IEEE VIS2017_, held in Phoenix, AZ, USA.

While visualization techniques are starting to pervade our work and leisure, we feel that there are many opportunities to use explanatoryvisualizations in teaching and learning. The Explanatory Visualization Framework (EVF) guides a learner to think through an explanatory visualization task, consider alternative solutions and reflect on their design, implementation choices, and actions. The framework is designed to provide a good balance between fostering creative thinking and providing the structured guidance that students need. It also enables teachers to swap-in their favoured exercise or assessment and apply the model to their situation. By creating their own explanatory visualizations, students learn and develop their creative, reflection and communication skills.
