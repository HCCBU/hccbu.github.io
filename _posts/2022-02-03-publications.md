Our journal article ["One View Is Not Enough: Review of and Encouragement for Multiple and Alternative Representations in 3D and Immersive Visualisation"]({{site.baseurl}}/publications#Roberts-et-al-MDPI-2022) has been accepted for publication in [_MDPI Computers_](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/computers/special_issues/CGVC_2021), in a special issue with invited extended publications from EG CGVC 2021.

 In this paper, using several case studies, we discuss the challenges and opportunities for using multiple views in immersive visualisation. Our aim is to provide a set of concepts that will enable developers to perform critical thinking, creative thinking and push the boundaries of what is possible with 3D and immersive visualisation.
