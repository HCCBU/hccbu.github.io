Our IEEE TVCG journal article ["VRIA: A Web-based Framework for Creating Immersive Analytics Experiences"]({{site.baseurl}}/publications#Butcher-et-al-TVCG-2020) will be presented at the virtual IEEE VIS 2020 [_IEEE VIS 2020_](http://ieeevis.org/year/2020/welcome).

&#60;VRIA&#62; is a Web-based framework, built for creating Immersive Analytics (IA) experiences in Virtual Reality. &#60;VRIA&#62; is built upon WebVR, A-Frame, React and D3.js, and offers a visualization creation workflow which enables users, of different levels of expertise, to rapidly develop Immersive Analytics experiences for the Web. More info on this paper can be found [here]({{site.baseurl}}/news/2020/01/04/publications/), whereas the &#60;VRIA&#62; framework can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/vriajs).

We will also be presenting a poster, titled ["Immersive visualisation of COVID-19 UK travel and US happiness data"]({{site.baseurl}}/publications#Williams-et-al-VIS-2020), written with our undergraduate interns, Rhys Williams and Dan Farmer, along with Prof J.C. Roberts. The work was supported by the [Bangor University Undergraduate Internship Scheme](https://www.bangor.ac.uk/skills-and-employability/index.php.en).
