Our journal article ["Virtual Forestry Generation: Evaluating Models for Tree Placement in Games"]({{site.baseurl}}/publications#Williams-et-al-MDPI-2020) has been accepted for publication in [_MDPI Computers_](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/computers/special_issues/CGVC_2019), in a special issue with invited extended publications from EG CGVC 2019.

In this article, we present a user study into virtual forests, using three different approaches of spatially distributing trees to approximate a plant community. These three approaches consisted of a random uniform distribution algorithm, a asymmetric plant competition model, and an iterative random distribution algorithm for creating clusters of trees. Our results demonstrate that the asymmetric plant competition model (the ‘Propagation’ algorithm) produces forests which were rated the highest in terms of playability and believability, for both 2D and 3D aerial perspectives.
