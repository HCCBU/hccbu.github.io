Our paper ["Wizualization: A ``Hard Magic'' Visualization System for Immersive and Ubiquitous Analytics"]({{site.baseurl}}/publications#Batch-et-al-TVCG-2024) has been accepted for publication at [IEEE VIS 2023](https://ieeevis.org/year/2023/welcome) and will appear in [IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/tg). 

In this paper, we introduce Wizualization, a visual analytics system for eXtended Reality (XR) that enables an analyst to author and interact with visualizations using a system based on a 'hard-magic' metaphor, through gestures, speech commands, and touch interaction. We demonstrate Wizualization and its components using a motivating scenario on collaborative data analysis of pandemic data, across time and space. We describe our system using a viginette-based scenario, the actors of which are shown in our teaser, above.
