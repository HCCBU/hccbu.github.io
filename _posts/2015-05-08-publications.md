Our publication [Visualization Beyond the Desktop - the next big thing](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6879056) was invited and presented in [VIS2015](http://www.ieeevis.org), held in Chicago, IL. Our paper presents a road-map to the future of data visualization, facilitated from a technological metamorphosis in interface design, towards a mixed reality world, that encompasses various sensors, is transparent to the user and can be accessed via the Web.

{% figure vis_perception png caption:"Visualization processes between the computer and human. Data is mapped onto perceptual variables and presented through various technologies. This all occurs in a particular place—a space with context (for example, a classroom, laboratory, or means of transportation). Through perception we acquire meaning of the presented data and awareness of our context." %}
