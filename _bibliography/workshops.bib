	abstract={This paper explores the use of scenario-based visualisation examples as a pedagogical strategy for teaching students the complexities of data insight, representation, and interpretation. Teaching data visualisation often involves explaining intricate issues related to data management and the challenges of presenting data meaningfully. In this work, we present a series of data-driven scenarios. These concise stories depict specific situations, and are created to help the educators highlight key concerns in data communication, such as chart selection, temporal versus categorical comparison, visual bias, and narrative framing. By grounding these examples in real-world contexts, students are encouraged to critically assess not only what the data shows, but how and why it is shown that way. This approach aims to deepen students’ data literacy and awareness of the ethical, analytical, and rhetorical choices that shape effective visual storytelling. The paper presents a collection of example scenarios, that educators can use for their own lessons; the work fits with a larger project on looking at critical thinking in the classroom, and developing appropriate tools. We also start to abstract principles, from our approach, so that others can develop their own scenarios for their teaching. Our approach aligns with principles of authentic and scenario-based learning, using real-world contexts to foster critical engagement with data.},

The technique was developed by one of the teams in the RAMPVIS project, which provided visualization support to epidemiological modeling during the COVID-19 pandemic. The team explored the prevailing approaches, in the UK and internationally, for creating public-facing visualizations related to the pandemic. This ranged from those produced by a number of governments (e.g., the four home nations in the UK), organizations (e.g., WHO, UK ONS), universities (e.g., Johns Hopkins dashboards), media outlets (e.g., FT Coronavirus tracker), and non-commercial web services (e.g., Worldometers). The team concluded that we should complement, but not duplicate, the existing effort, and defined our goal as to inform the public through advanced storytelling visualization.},

The visualization volunteers were organized into seven teams, including a generic support team, an analytical support team, a disseminative visualization team, and four modeling support teams. During the volunteering activities, we encountered a few major challenges. We made an effort to address these challenges and gained useful experience.},

Papercrafting is cheap and quick to produce, and easily disposed of. Papercrafting student data is powerful as it acts as a focal point for discussions about the progression of their students and the effects of any extenuating circumstances. During such meetings teachers often reference spreadsheets and dashboard visualisations to explore the data. They focus and shift their attention to individual students, often commenting on individual performance and circumstances in turn. Tangible depictions, such as the ones we present, can be passed around, facilitating discussions, and can act as a focal-point for conversation. We present several prototypes and discuss our design process.},

At the same time, teachers want their students to think critically about their assignments and plan how they will build an interface. We have developed, and used for two academic years, a structured ``critical thinking sheet (CTS)''. It is a method to help students consider a problem from different views, and help them critically consider different aspects of the task. The sheet gets the learners to (1) sketch the solution, (2) explain the challenge, (3) detail system components, (4) list algorithmic steps, and (5) explain next steps and issues of implementation. In this paper we introduce the sheet, explain how we have used it, and discuss learner experience.},

Data brokers receive, clean, store and re-sell data from many clients. However the usage of the data and the brokering process can be improved at source by enhancing the client's data creation and management processes. We propose to achieve this through providing formative feedback, as a visualisation report, to the client. Working closely with a travel agent data broker, we present a three-part framework, where we (1) evaluate data creation and provision processes of the client, (2) develop metrics for quantitative analytics on the data, (3) aggregate the analytics in a visual report.},

	abstract={The deployment of real-world water monitoring and analytics tools is still far behind the growing needs of cities, which are facing constant urbanisation and overgrowth of the population. This paper presents a full-stack data-mining infrastructure for smart water management for cities being developed within Water4Cities project. The stack is tested in two use cases - Greek island of Skiathos and Slovenian capital Ljubljana, each facing its own challenges related to groundwater. Bottom layer of the platform provides data gathering and provision infrastructure based on IoT standards. The layer is enriched with a dedicated missing data imputation infrastructure, which supports coherent analysis of long-term impacts of urbanisation and population growth on groundwater reserves. Data-driven approach to groundwater levels analysis, which is important for decision support in flood and groundwater management, has shown promising results and could replace or complement traditional process-driven models. Data visualization capabilities of the platform expose powerful synergies with data mining and contribute significantly to the design of future decision support systems in water management for cities.},

	abstract={We, like other educators, are keen to develop the next generation of visualisation designers. The use of sketching and low-fidelity designs are becoming popular methods to help developers and students consider many alternative ideas and plan what they should build. But especially within an education setting, there are often many issues that challenge students as they create low-fidelity prototypes. Students can be unwilling to contemplate alternatives, reluctant to use pens and paper, or sketch on paper, and inclined to code the first idea in their mind. In this paper we discuss these issues, and investigate strategies to help increase the breadth of low-fidelity designs, especially for developing data-visualisation tools. We draw together experiences and advice of how we have used the Five Design-Sheets method over eight years, for different assessment styles and across two institutions. This paper would be useful for anyone who wishes to use sketching in their teaching, or to improve their own experiences.},

	abstract={Information visualisation has become a key element for empowering users to answer and produce new questions, make sense and create narratives about specific sets of information. Current technologies, such as Linked Data, have changed how researchers and professionals in the Humanities and the Heritage sector engage with information. Digital literacy is of concern in many sectors, but is especially of concern for Digital Humanities. This is due to the fact that the Humanities and Heritage sector face an important division based on digital literacy that produce gaps in the way research can be carried out. One way to overcome the challenge of digital literacy and improve access to information can be Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs), which allow a more meaningful and natural pathway for a wide range of users. TUIs make use of physical objects to interact with the computer. In particular, they can facilitate the interaction process between the user and a data visualisation system. This position paper discusses the opportunity to engage with Digital Humanities information via TUIs and data visualisation tools, offering new ways to analyse, investigate and interpret the past.},

We are seeking new ways to contextualize, visualize, interact-with and interpret our data. In this paper we present the notion of Synthetic Visualizations, which enable us to visualize in situ, data embedded in physical objects, using MR. We use a combination of established ‘markers’, such as Quick Response Codes (QR Codes) and Augmented Reality Markers (AR Markers), not only to register objects in physical space, but also to contain data to be visualized, and interchange the type of visualization to be used. We visualize said data in Mixed Reality (MR), using emerging web-technologies and open-standards.},

	abstract="Learners have personal data, such as grades, feedback and statistics on how they fair or compare with the class. But, data focusing on their personal learning is lacking, as it does not get updated regularly (being updated at the end of a taught session) and the displayed information is generally a single grade. Consequently, it is difficult for students to use this information to adapt their behavior, and help them on their learning journey. Yet, there is a rich set of data that could be captured and help students learn better. What is required is dynamically, regularly updated personal data, that is displayed to students in a timely way. Such ‘personal data’ can be presented to the student through ‘personal visualizations’ that engender ‘personal learning’. In this paper we discuss our journey into developing learning systems and our resulting experience with learners. We present a vision, to integrate new technologies and visualization solutions, in order to encourage and develop personal learning that employs the visualization of personal learning data."

Likewise, while the desktop as-we-know-it is dead (the use of the WIMP interface is becoming obsolete in visualization) it is being superseded by a new type of desktop environment: a multisensory visualization space. This space is still a personal workspace, it’s just a new kind of desk environment.

and interactive visualizations that provide visual depictions and analysis throughout the lifetime of the
learner, monitoring their progress from novices to experts. We therefore encourage researchers to take a comprehensive
approach and re-think how visual analytics can be applied to the learning environment, and develop more
interactive and exploratory interfaces for the learner and teacher.}
