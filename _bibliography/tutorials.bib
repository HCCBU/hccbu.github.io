	abstract={Immersive, situated, and ubiquitous analytics (IA/SA/UA) envision scenarios where heterogeneous devices can be used in combination and multiple users can work in collaboration around data. While there are many research prototypes in this domain, there is a lack of a common platform to build upon. Furthermore, many prototypes build on proprietary game engines such as Unreal or Unity, which make distribution and reuse more difficult, require niche knowledge which is not often found in enterprise environments, as well as being prone to changing license agreements. We therefore advocate for the use of open standards, such as WebXR in order to overcome such restrictions. During the last year we created two iterations of an open, malleable, and collaborative platform for IA/SA/UA: DashSpace. We published both DashSpace as well as a its core WebXR framework Spatialstrates on GitHub. DashSpace and Spatialstrates build on the know-how and technical synergies between Web-based IA/SA frameworks, such as VRIA and Wizualization, UA frameworks such as Vistrates, and dynamic-media environments such as Webstrates, all converging together since 2019, through the binding affordances that the reliance on Web technologies enables.

	We deem the tutorial framing particularly well suited to introduce DashSpace in depth to a broader audience of IA/SA/UA researchers, with the goal of creating a growing and interoperable platform for these interaction flavors. We envision to grow the platform and create a “component store” or package repository with self-contained components and packages that can be mixed and matched within the same platform without the need to install new applications on multiple devices or re-implementing common features.}

	title = {{Sketching Designs for Data-Visualization using the Five Design-Sheet Methodology}},
	year = {2016},
	booktitle = {Tutorials of at the IEEE Conference on Visualization (IEEE VIS 2016), Baltimore, MD, USA},
	month={October},
	abstract={The tutorial will be useful for anyone who has to create visualization interfaces, and needs to think through different potential ways to display their data. At the end of the tutorial participants will understand techniques to help them be more structured in their ideation. They will be able to sketch interface designs using the Five Design Sheet methodology (FdS). While we know that some developers have started to use the Five Design-Sheet methodology, but this tutorial will start from the beginning and be suitable for any attendee. More information and resources are found on http://fds.design.}

	year = {2017},
	booktitle = {Tutorials of at the IEEE Conference on Visualization (IEEE VIS 2017), Phoenix, AZ, USA},
	month={October},
	abstract={This tutorial leads attendees through sketching designs following the Five Design-Sheet methodology (FdS) and discusses how it can be used in teaching. The first part (before the break) will introduce the FdS, place it in context with other methods, discuss creative thinking and different problem types, explain the benefit of sketching designs, and provide a worked example of the FdS. The second part (after the break) focuses on using the FdS in teaching in Higher Education We give examples of students’ work, and discuss issues and challenges of using sketching for designing and prototyping in teaching, followed by a question and answer session.},
