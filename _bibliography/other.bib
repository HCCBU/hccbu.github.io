	abstract = {The Visualisation Data Modelling & Graphics (VDMG) research group at Bangor University brings together researchers in visualisation, modelling, data-mining and Artificial Intelligence. Our vision is to help people understand data, depict it visually and deliver enjoyable experiences. We design, develop and evaluate computing solutions that often incorporate AI, machine learning, interaction, underpinned with advanced computing, and are always user-focused. Located in Bangor University – a civic University on the North Wales shoreline that is close to the Snowdonia mountain range and National Park – much of our research is inspired by nature, motivated to be sustainable, and people focused.},

	abstract={Augmented Reality technology has been used in medical visualization applications in various different ways. Haptics, on the other hand, are a popular method of interacting in Augmented and Virtual Reality environments. We present how reliance on standards benefits the fusion of these technologies, through a series of research themes, carried out in Bangor University, UK (and international partners), as well as within the activities domain of the Research Institute of Visual Computing (RIVIC), UK.}

	abstract={An important aspect of designing and implementing Augmented Reality (AR) applications and services, often disregarded for the sake of simplicity and speed, is the evaluation of such systems, particularly from non-expert users, in real operating conditions. We are strong advocates of the fact that in order to develop successful and highly immersive AR systems, that can be adopted in day-today scenarios, user assessment and feedback is of paramount importance. Consequently, we also feel that an important fragment of future AR Standardisation should focus on User eXperience (UX) aspects, such as the sense of presence, ergonomics, health and safety, overall usability and product identification. Our paper attempts an examination of these aspects and proposes an adaptive theoretical evaluation framework than can be standardised across the span of AR applications.}

  abstract={Insights into activities we undertake as educators and students have the potential to enhance learning and reduce unintentional consequences for all. Educators have for a long time used data to monitor students and grade them. More recently additional yet still traditional metrics have been added to the available tools in every day education. The latest generation of information are derived metrics with additional intelligence. This project has developed a Work Pressure metric than can be used by both educator and learner. The focus is on the assessments for a given programme and Work Pressure that this generates. Additionally, included is behavioural characteristics, these have the potential to have significant impact upon the individual student journey.},

  title={Virtual Reality Demonstrator of an Advanced Boiling Reactor},
  author={Ritsos, Panagiotis D. and Roberts, Jonathan C.},
  year={2018},
  institution={Bangor University},
  type={Technical Report},
  abstract={
	  This feasibility study presents an overview of the development of a prototype HMD-based VR demonstration of an ABWR facility. The demonstration aims to present to the user 3D simulations of how an Advanced Boiling Water Reactor looks like, and eventually how it works. By providing this immersive demonstration, users can learn about this technology, its significance, explore the facility virtually and learn about the potential of nuclear power in an immersive, interactive and highly engaging manner. The prototype was designed from the outset to be extensible and adaptable to include additional information in the future, such as data-driven informational annotations and immersive visual analytics. The feasibility study demonstrated the ease and flexibility of modern game engines and VR interfaces, in prototyping a VR simulator, intended as a for demonstration tool for an ABWR. However, it also highlighted the need for high-quality 3D models of the elements of the reactor that are to be depicted, in enhance immersion and realism of depiction. Moreover, if any informational overlays are to be used, in conjunction with the 3D information, these need to be sourced from informative and accurate datasets, that would accompany the aforementioned 3D models. Finally, as the set-up used in this effort is not mobile, and outreach activities would benefit from such mobility, we have started exploring the development of a Web-based, mobile solution that uses a simpler, highly-portable infrastructure.},
